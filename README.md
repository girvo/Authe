# Authe
## A Framework Agnostic Authentication Library

The name will be changed as this is filled out, this will do for now!

This project is entirely MIT Licensed, with the exception of the libraries in 
the ````vendor```` directory. This directory is only temporary and will be 
removed in the very near future (a simple ````composer install```` should be 
enough to get **Authe** up and running).
